Using the boxplot to compare the flinal tumor volume, it become clear that ramicane and capomulin were most successful at reducing the tumor volume with the exception of one outlier in the infubinol group. Through the line grapy, you can see that the course for one single mouse shows an initial increase in tumor volume, but as the medicine takes effect, you begin to see a decrease in tumor volume. It appears that the effects cap out at around 35 weeks as the tumor size begins to increase. That might gear medical professionals to limit the time used to 35 weeks for this drug, and consider changing drugs after the 35 weeks mark. However, we are looking at one mouse in this example, and it might be worthwhile to look at a larger sample size of mice before making clinical decisions. The last take away from this data is that there is a positive correlation between the weight of a mouse and tumor volume which seems pretty intuitive that as tumor mass increases, so would the total mass of the mouse.
